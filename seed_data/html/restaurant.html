<h1>Our Restaurant – excellent dining experience</h1>
<p>Our light and airy, newly refurbished restaurant combines traditional features like oak beams with modern styling and décor to provide a contemporary, country restaurant. With its glass fronted wine room and graceful Swan chandelier it makes a lovely place to enjoy a leisurely meal.</p>
<p>The restaurant is also available to hire for larger dining parties and functions. We can comfortably accommodate 30-35 people for private dining, and the restaurant makes a stylish venue for family celebrations, private functions and business meetings alike.  We will always try to provide personal menus for customers booking private functions when needed. Please get in touch to discuss your requirements or arrange a meeting.</p>
<p>Our chefs are serious about providing excellent food and drink to all our customers and we pride ourselves on providing the best quality gastro style menu. We vary our menus regularly and source the best local ingredients.</p>
<p>We cook all our steaks and burgers on a char pit, giving them that fabulous flavour that only cooking on an open fire gives. We also have an extensive range of local real ales, craft beers and fine wines for you to choose from.</p>
