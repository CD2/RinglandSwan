<h1>About us</h1>
<p>The Ringland Swan has been fully refurbished and now provides one of the best pubs in Norfolk along with offering a fine dining experience in our restaurant.</p>
<p>We’ve retained traditional elements such as the beamed ceiling, exposed brickwork, stone floors and floorboards and combined them with a modern, contemporary design and décor.</p>
<p>The new bar and restaurant both offer comfortable surroundings whatever the weather. The double sided wood burner provides a lovely place to sit when you come in after a walk or on cold winter days.</p>
<p>The cosy welcome is also echoed by hosts Donna and Simon Littleboy and the staff at the Swan. You can always be sure of receiving a warm, friendly welcome whether you are dining in the restaurant or having a drink in the bar.</p>
<p>We have a large garden which makes a lovely backdrop for eating al fresco in the summer.</p>
<p>It’s important to us that all members of the family can enjoy themselves at The Swan. With our new children’s play area The Swan makes a great choice for families looking for child friendly restaurants near Norwich.  Children of all ages are welcome and we have a special menu just for them. We also have great baby changing facilities.</p>
<p>Dogs are welcome in the bar area. So if you’re looking for a dog friendly pub in Norfolk, The Swan is an ideal choice and means you don’t have to leave your four legged family members at home.</p>
<p>We have full disabled access and facilities.</p>
<p>The Swan has a large off-road car park.</p>
